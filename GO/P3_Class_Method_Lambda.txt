// Class and Object

// A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. 
//   It defines the properties (member variables) and 
//   behaviors (methods) that objects created from the class will have.
// An object is an instance of a class, containing specific 
//   values for the properties defined by the class.
// Key Concepts:

// Member Variables: These are variables declared in a class, 
//   representing the attributes of the object.
// Methods: Functions defined within a class, representing 
//   the actions or behaviors an object can perform.
